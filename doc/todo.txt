todo:

    

- fix blur so items don't get bigger



- jump, collisions


- platform tops

- water foam

- animation move speed needs to match char move speed


- rotation : pitch, roll, yaw

- lighting * shadders





- fix projection seams!!!!!


- fix ramps, also ramp along z


- draw shadder under top on side



- get char liquid intersection point!!!!!


- fix npc roam code
- npc number/type/frequency and kind set in level and theme respectively



*** nice to have top, side and front views..........




- platform tops (grass etc) should project a bit. also roundness is double-plus good.













- GameController can be smarter and cleaner




// 3D
- handle roundness and craziness
    -> craziness is part of renderer?
- glom polys together, filter inner points & draw crazy round 


- fade colors on blur canvas
- find a way to bleach items in distance




- better specificity for which edges to draw - i.e. platform backgrounds need top edges
- draw shadders under top edge


- option to make liquid transparent...need to use render mask with graident. would look supercool
- draw liquid wave  and foam effects



dialogs
================================
- collapse
- remember position
- remember size
- add dialog wrangle command?
- keyboard commands for controls?
- respond to window resize





- make background items animate less frewuently
- control item animation rate in cache?
- item animation cycle can be handled in cache (instead of individual classes)






- select item to debug





- set camera sway by view type and level




- how hard and expensive is it to skew?
- how hard and expensive is it to light?


- slopes a bit slopery

- craziness and roundness for 3D projection
    - can i get rid of seams?

- option to turn off animation (i.e. blur)



- water

- item angles









-- implement view image tiles!!!!

- player shadders








- make sure wind is in the overall same direction for all grass

    





- cache all cachables on first run of level (prevent slowdown when loading the first time)




- need [option] to move complex items into json files
- items & theme items should be able to live in separate files





- item animations not a thing








- slopes jittery going up and in general
- vertical movers wanky with passenger



- draw outline over background arm

- rotate groups (body, headface, etc)


- master json config file:
    - debug
    - outlines
    - resolution/quality
    - zoom (css scale) or not
    - basic player/game physics
    - other stuff
    

- get rid of local storage...? save game state as json?

- lerp item movement - still fucky






- jump max height only when button held
- jump height depends on velX
- pause at apex of jump



- make view padding dynamic:
    1P: tight when still, zoom out when moving. Make zoom a function of speed
    MP: tight when close, zoom out when further apart



- particles (flames) need blank canvas so bg doesn't influence color



- better scenery rendering :
    - clipping seems to be an issue with rocks (msedge & safari)
    - make sure rock details don't overlap
    - (optional) outlines


- hitboxes and collision is still fucky!!!


- fix item renderer

- outline all the things!!!


- environment shit: bugs, birds, leaves, flowers, wisps

- ropes/vines

- things in extreme FG

- grass & environment animations - gentle sway and react to player enturbulation






- curve and hump geometry support




- jump window before/after touch ground - need to fix this

- tile variances (darker and lighter)


- Ellipse and set line dash not supported by everybody


- hash nav not working in MS browsers




- fire particles need to respect physics better...





- reduce obj creation









- (full) controller support




- see if water can invert to make more classic looking waves with peaks










- draw attention to player damage and respawn!!






- tiles

- torches

- quicksand (and in general)


- particles



- water/lava/sand/goo fall

- death & respawn


- more advanced movers (path, rotate)
  
 




- grass / trees / flowers



 
 



- ramps need to slide

    













- see if there is a way to slow game speed w/o delta stepper
- unify game timestamps (animation, player, debug) to all use loop timer for now() - need solution to last(), likely a function...
















- sync dev ui when loading - save settings would be nice











- need list of item properties : draw, collide, collide-top, canjump, collide-damage, collide-kill, collide-bounce...


- implement "real" WebRTC phone controller





- weapons & death

- hotkeys

- pause game (grey screen)

- toggle sound icon & sound in general

- settings


- fix all animations

- need multiple "idle" animations (choose randomly but wisely!)

- custom name, color, stats



- find out why player4 is "stronger" than other players - something to do with update order...? (he gets processed last so always wins)

- level editor

- player editor






























- player stats:     health =/= strength =/= speed
                    fast and weak vs. strong and slow - choose wisely!
                    
                    i.e. you get 20 points to spend...
                    
                    health:   XXXXXXXX--
                    strength: XXXXX-----
                    speed:    XXXXXXX---
                    
                    - size of character is based on strength - weak characters are small, strong characters are big?
                    - * need a way to immediately represent how healthy a player is (including what percent is left?)
                    - strength: weight in collisions, power when pushing, movement speed when lifting




- Use 'Bounty Hunters' as a story framework? Detective agency? Pizza delivery?



- "The Boondoggle" -> Map name?


- Rock Paper Scissors with player classes?  -> Bruiser -> Hero -> Pinto ->
