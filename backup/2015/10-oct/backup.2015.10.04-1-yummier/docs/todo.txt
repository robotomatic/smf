- stretch when jumping, compress when falling

- add random blink, look around state
  - need multiple "idle" animations (choose randomly but wisely!)
  
- draw pixel grid if debug mode

- add collision box to players to prevent sliding when jumping

- add cushion to game view scaling

- fix player at edge-of-bounds camera situation

- find out why player4 is "stronger" than other players - something to do with update order...?

- implement "real" WebRTC phone controller

- quads for render and collide: load static level items in areaQuad, actors in pointQuad

- "bullet through paper" is still a thing: need to fix collisions!!!

- Better camera system: 
    - need camera hit box to prevent jumpiness

- remove fake level/player/camera loader

- level editor
- ramps

- player editor
- player stats:     health =/= strength =/= speed
                    fast and weak vs. strong and slow - choose wisely!
                    
                    i.e. you get 20 points to spend...
                    
                    health:   XXXXXXXX--
                    strength: XXXXX-----
                    speed:    XXXXXXX---
                    
- size of character is based on strength - weak characters are small, strong characters are big?
- * need a way to immediately represent how healthy a player is (including what percent is left?)
- strength: weight in collisions, power when pushing, movement speed when lifting

- 8-bit reservoir dogs chars? "kill the gimps!"

- horses in suits named Charlie and Whinney
