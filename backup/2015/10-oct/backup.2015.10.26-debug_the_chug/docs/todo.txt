todo:

- annoying pop-in with dev tools divider. pick a better color and remove opacity

- first char jumpy glitch thing - is this still a thing?
- player UI sometimes fucked when view is unscaled? - this this still a thing?



- unify game timestamps (animation, player, debug) to all use loop timer for now() - need solution to last(), likely a function...

- spacebar to pause: 

- sync dev ui when loading - save settings would be nice

- smooth x in party_view the same as y to prevent (unwanted) screenshake


- need to fade buttons much quicker when leaving game mode

- collision fails if moving diagonally at corner when using x & y hit boxes

- logo take too long to load - better, but still...

- customize label shows up after player ready for some fucked up reason



- add timer for pre-button push for jumps: still feels "floaty" sometimes like I should have jumed but didn't (pressed too soon i think)

- ramps/rotation

- most assets can be cached - render 1 block at a given resolution and stamp the rest (!)

- smoother scrolling on level chooser: maybe 1 double-sized canvas panel?

- scale outline weight

- more than 1 visible canvas: 1 for each cached layer. draw once and move relative to fg canvas

- game camera situation - much better! keep working on it. someday figure out what lerp really is

- add water/lava/goo

- need list of item properties : draw, collide, collide-top, canjump, collide-damage, collide-kill, collide-bounce...

- add optional theme physics modifiers (jungle, lava, ice, space, ...)

- implement "real" WebRTC phone controller



- weapons & death

- hotkeys

- pause game (grey screen)

- toggle sound icon & sound in general

- settings

- armies & leggies

- stretch when jumping, compress when falling

- add random blink, look around state
  - need multiple "idle" animations (choose randomly but wisely!)

- custom name, color, stats

- draw pixel grid if debug mode

- quads for render and collide: load static level items in areaQuad, actors in pointQuad

- find out why player4 is "stronger" than other players - something to do with update order...?

- level editor

- player editor

- player stats:     health =/= strength =/= speed
                    fast and weak vs. strong and slow - choose wisely!
                    
                    i.e. you get 20 points to spend...
                    
                    health:   XXXXXXXX--
                    strength: XXXXX-----
                    speed:    XXXXXXX---
                    
                    - size of character is based on strength - weak characters are small, strong characters are big?
                    - * need a way to immediately represent how healthy a player is (including what percent is left?)
                    - strength: weight in collisions, power when pushing, movement speed when lifting



- 8-bit reservoir dogs chars? "kill the gimp!"
- horses in suits named Charlie and Whinney
