- A game that berates you as you play. "You suck" "You can't make this jump" "Big deal. Who Cares?" Something like an expression of what it's like to have depression and anxiety

- Something about needing to replace a spike that binds the multiverse..need to double-check this isn't stolen from Dark Tower...

- Babu or Baaboo or Baboo has a nice ring to it. Check for other uses first, but is a great name for a game of some kind

- A world where people's identity is digital and some people are basically retarded due to tech limits when they were digitized

Drugs are social. You all trip together. Illegal, but tolarated - addiction is epidemic. Everyone does.

Tech is Nanopsychotropic. You touch each other and interact with the world, just in a total different sensual space.

The illusion overlays reality with your choice of illusion.
Look how you want to look. Sound how you want to sound. Be who you want to be.


Impossible to tell if someone is drugged unless you are also drugged. Then you don't know who isn't. But most are. Realies are shunned.


While dosed, it's possible to tell the simulation is running if you look for it. 
There are tells. 
But, some people choose to don't look and live like their version of real is the only one.



Trouble is, people keep dying in virtual real space, from an untraceable horror. A very dangerous ghost in the machine.



Drug is manufactured by Overcorp to bribe foreign ambassidors? Anyways, Tech is government funded on the secret.
Killer is AI virus injected to The Framework to eliminate political targets. 

Tech leaked. VR drug is everywhere. Virtual Assasin got loose and is running wild in the shared virtual space. No-one is safe.


Trace to the top, BigBad says why ruin it? Life sucks. Check it out. Shit's all wrecked up. 


But really really? Outside is all lush and green not all wrecked up like BigBoss said.
