todo:




- collision needs to respond to y hit before processing x
    
- trees enfuckulated at higher rez REWRITE IMMINENT


---> consolidate all draw calls into geom classes

-------------- scratch that --> all CANVAS calls? 

-----> geom classes inherit shape prototype
--------> shape class handles ALL draw calls and shape cache


- slopes jittery going up and in general
- vertical movers wanky with passenger


- loading characters in uncontrolled order - need to keep better track of who is playing? remove local storage altogether for now?

- draw outline over background arm

- rotate groups (body, headface, etc)


- master json config file:
    - debug
    - outlines
    - resolution/quality
    - zoom (css scale) or not
    - basic player/game physics
    - other stuff
    

- get rid of local storage...? save game state as json?

- lerp item movement - still fucky




- game slow after running level chooser. need to refresh to fix...?


- acceleration
- jump max height only when button held
- jump height depends on velX
- pause at apex of jump



- make view padding dynamic:
    1P: tight when still, zoom out when moving. Make zoom a function of speed
    MP: tight when close, zoom out when further apart



- particles (flames) need blank canvas so bg doesn't influence color


- logging & error trapping: window.on_error()


- better scenery rendering :
    - bushes need helps
    - grass is too low-fi
    - clipping seems to be an issue with rocks
    - make sure rock details don't overlap
    - (optional) outlines


- hitboxes and collision is still fucky!!!


- fix item renderer

- outline all the things!!!


- environment shit: bugs, birds, leaves, flowers, wisps

- ropes/vines

- things in extreme FG

- grass & environment animations - gentle sway and react to player enturbulation



- clipping fucked for ground rock thingmies ----> geometry draw call .beginPath() messes with clip path...better to change to composite op


- background moves splanky

- curve and hump geometry support


- quad tree????!?!??!?!?!?!!??!??


- jump window before/after touch ground - need to fix this

- tile variances (darker and lighter)


- Ellipse and set line dash not supported by everybody
- navigator.gamepad not supported by everybody


- hash nav not working in MS browsers




- fire particles need to respect physics better...





- reduce obj creation









- (full) controller support

- make sure spawn is safe



- wave amplitude is (incorrectly) a function of view size
- see if water can invert to make more classic looking waves with peaks

- flag start point uckfayed



- grass should always render in front of player
** Nope : Player remains behind colliders _unless_ player is jumping!!!1
- control player z-index somehow




- wave (actually, all) physics should be loaded from level instead of theme (or hard coded...i'm looking at YOU stage.js)


- parallax fucked in MP mode *correction - all modes* - players need to respect parallax...what does this mean? *removed for now


- need base shape class
- move all draw functions to primitives...ugh...

- add shadow to bg - store bg id & poly memory, clip and draw shadow later...can use this for trees tooo 

- make platform top a separate class
- make stone (rock) a separate class
- make grass a separate class

- load renderers better! differentiate between structure and material




- draw attention to player damage and respawn!!






- tiles

- torches

- quicksand (and in general)


- particles




- water/lava/sand/goo fall

- death & respawn


- more advanced movers (path, rotate)
  
 




- grass / trees / flowers



 
 
- common styles



- ramps need to slide

    













- see if there is a way to slow game speed w/o delta stepper





- center player better when not on lowest ground layer...need to hamdle ground not being bottom of level!!!!! 









- unify game timestamps (animation, player, debug) to all use loop timer for now() - need solution to last(), likely a function...


- sync dev ui when loading - save settings would be nice









- smoother scrolling on level chooser: maybe 1 double-sized canvas panel?


- more than 1 visible canvas: 1 for each cached layer. draw once and move relative to fg canvas


- need list of item properties : draw, collide, collide-top, canjump, collide-damage, collide-kill, collide-bounce...

- add optional theme physics modifiers (jungle, lava, ice, space, ...)

- implement "real" WebRTC phone controller



- weapons & death

- hotkeys

- pause game (grey screen)

- toggle sound icon & sound in general

- settings


- fix all animations

- add random blink, look around state
- need multiple "idle" animations (choose randomly but wisely!)

- custom name, color, stats

- draw pixel grid if debug mode

- quads for render and collide: load static level items in areaQuad, actors in pointQuad
  https://github.com/mikechambers/ExamplesByMesh/tree/master/JavaScript/QuadTree

- find out why player4 is "stronger" than other players - something to do with update order...?

- level editor

- player editor






























- player stats:     health =/= strength =/= speed
                    fast and weak vs. strong and slow - choose wisely!
                    
                    i.e. you get 20 points to spend...
                    
                    health:   XXXXXXXX--
                    strength: XXXXX-----
                    speed:    XXXXXXX---
                    
                    - size of character is based on strength - weak characters are small, strong characters are big?
                    - * need a way to immediately represent how healthy a player is (including what percent is left?)
                    - strength: weight in collisions, power when pushing, movement speed when lifting




- Use 'Bounty Hunters' as a story framework? Detective agency? Pizza delivery?



- "The Boondoggle" -> Map name?


- Rock Paper Scissors with player classes?  -> Bruiser -> Hero -> Pinto ->
