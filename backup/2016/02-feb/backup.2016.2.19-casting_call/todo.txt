- 'use strict'

- unify draw calls

- | 0
- give arrays type hints
- prototype -> module
- reduce obj creation





fix player hitboxes, speed & jump height

trashcat tail
ninja stuff
yeti walk **chest

- rotate group
- draw rotated round


- camera and mover lerp

- fix player multiple collision box thing so ramps work better

- draw player collision box debug

- controller support

- make sure spawn is safe


- lerp bg parallax

- wave amplitude is (incorrectly) a function of view size

- flag start point uckfayed

- rock collision box afu


- grass should always render in front of player
** Nope : PLayer remains behind colliders _unless_ player is jumping!!!1

- control player z-index somehow


- is it possible to lerp between animations?


- wave (actually, all) physics should be loaded from level instead of theme (or hard coded...i'm looking at YOU stage.js)


- parallax fucked in MP mode - players need to respect parallax...what does this mean? *removed for now


- need base shape class
- move all draw functions to primitives...ugh...

- add shadow to bg - store bg id & poly memory, clip and draw shadow later...can use this for trees tooo 

- make platform top a separate class
- make stone (rock) a separate class
- make grass a separate class

- load renderers better! differentiate between structure and material




- draw attention to player damage and respawn!!


- split json character, animation, and theme definitions into separate files by item




- tiles

- torches

- quicksand (and in general)


- particles




- water/lava/sand/goo fall

- death & respawn


- more advanced movers (path, rotate)
  
 




- grass / trees / flowers

- rocks


 
 
- common styles



- ramps need to slide

    

- player chooser #4 is a liar sometimes

- parallax is wrong





- still need to pad jump button a bit...before/after hitting ground -> jump_was_pressed...????/
- add timer for pre-button push for jumps: still feels "floaty" sometimes like I should have jumed but didn't (pressed too soon i think)

- jitter when moving left (but not right) into wall


- cache items at resolution by class name -> block-10-259 :: layer keeps collection ----> test more!!!!



- see if there is a way to slow game speed w/o delta stepper


- ugh. collsion still fucked
- collision fails if moving diagonally at corner when using x & y hit boxes



- center player better when not on lowest ground layer...need to hamdle ground not being bottom of level!!!!! 









- unify game timestamps (animation, player, debug) to all use loop timer for now() - need solution to last(), likely a function...


- sync dev ui when loading - save settings would be nice



- need to fade buttons much quicker when leaving game mode
- customize label shows up after player ready for some fucked up reason






- smoother scrolling on level chooser: maybe 1 double-sized canvas panel?

- scale outline weight

- more than 1 visible canvas: 1 for each cached layer. draw once and move relative to fg canvas


- need list of item properties : draw, collide, collide-top, canjump, collide-damage, collide-kill, collide-bounce...

- add optional theme physics modifiers (jungle, lava, ice, space, ...)

- implement "real" WebRTC phone controller



- weapons & death

- hotkeys

- pause game (grey screen)

- toggle sound icon & sound in general

- settings

- armies & leggies

- stretch when jumping, compress when falling

- add random blink, look around state
  - need multiple "idle" animations (choose randomly but wisely!)

- custom name, color, stats

- draw pixel grid if debug mode

- quads for render and collide: load static level items in areaQuad, actors in pointQuad

- find out why player4 is "stronger" than other players - something to do with update order...?

- level editor

- player editor

- player stats:     health =/= strength =/= speed
                    fast and weak vs. strong and slow - choose wisely!
                    
                    i.e. you get 20 points to spend...
                    
                    health:   XXXXXXXX--
                    strength: XXXXX-----
                    speed:    XXXXXXX---
                    
                    - size of character is based on strength - weak characters are small, strong characters are big?
                    - * need a way to immediately represent how healthy a player is (including what percent is left?)
                    - strength: weight in collisions, power when pushing, movement speed when lifting



- 8-bit reservoir dogs chars? "kill the gimp!"
- horses in suits named Charlie and Whinney


- Use 'Bounty Hunters' as a story framework?

- "Angie/Arthur Wreckhouse"

- Business Ferrets

- "The Boondoggle" 


- Rock Paper Scissors with player classes?  -> Bruiser -> Hero -> Pinto ->
