todo:


*** break "wide" or "high" or "deep" geometries up a bit -- add a point every x (or so) units so occlusion code is work good


    // fix pillar problem by making item parts that are not glommed into poly
    // even better make glommed items into glom group in file
    


- jump, collisions

- better dev control ov views

- items to image because blur


- platform tops

- water foam

- animation move speed needs to match char move speed


- rotation : pitch, roll, yaw

- lighting * shadders






- return player instead of render because blur
- return item instead of render because blur


- fix projection seams!!!!!


- fix ramps, also ramp along z


- draw shadder under top on side



- get char liquid intersection point!!!!!
- liquid properties set by theme!!!!
- add solid liquid you can run on?????


- fix npc roam code
- add npc to map
- npc number/type/frequency and kind set in level and theme respectively



- create a type of platform that has a green front. use it.


*** nice to have top, side and front views..........





- grass sticks out a bit on the right side

- turn on/off & set tilt shift effect (radius, amount)
- tilt radius needs to elongate when jumping. will have to lerp back to size


- platform tops (grass etc) should project a bit. also roundness is double-plus good.










- grass needs more pad room


- dev: set camera x, y, z & snap (window to one/several/all chars) or stick to coords




- GameController can be smarter and cleaner




// 3D
- handle roundness and craziness
    -> craziness is part of renderer?
- glom polys together, filter inner points & draw crazy round 


- fade colors on blur canvas
- find a way to bleach items in distance

- make graphics an object

- fix draw order



- better specificity for which edges to draw - i.e. platform backgrounds need top edges
- draw shadders under top edge
- player can fall off left side of level


- option to make liquid transparent...need to use render mask with graident. would look supercool
- draw liquid wave  and foam effects



dialogs
================================
- collapse
- remember position
- remember size
- add dialog wrangle command?
- keyboard commands for controls?
- respond to window resize


debug dialogs
==================================
- show under menu, need to decide how to collapse



- sky doesn't fit


- make background items animate less frewuently
- control item animation rate in cache?
- item animation cycle can be handled in cache (instead of individual classes)

- grass fucky when zoomed in...?

- clouds not projecting right



- item debug isn't projecting right
- player collision debug isn't projecting right...maybe related to collision issues???

- clear out memory




- re-do stars....want to work like cache but occasionally animate


- select item to debug





- set camera sway by view type and level


***** figure out render x y z order ******


- how hard and expensive is it to skew?
- how hard and expensive is it to light?

- theme & default renderer

- slopes a bit slopery

- craziness and roundness for 3D projection
    - can i get rid of seams?

- option to turn off animation (i.e. blur)



- water

- item angles









-- implement view image tiles!!!!

- player shadders








- add a grass knuckle
- make sure wind is in the overall same direction for all grass

    





- cache all cachables on first run of level (prevent slowdown when loading the first time)




- need [option] to move complex items into json files
- items & theme items should be able to live in separate files





- item animations not a thing






---> consolidate all draw calls into geom classes
-------------- scratch that --> all CANVAS calls? 
-----> geom classes inherit shape prototype
--------> shape class handles ALL draw calls and shape cache


- slopes jittery going up and in general
- vertical movers wanky with passenger



- draw outline over background arm

- rotate groups (body, headface, etc)


- master json config file:
    - debug
    - outlines
    - resolution/quality
    - zoom (css scale) or not
    - basic player/game physics
    - other stuff
    

- get rid of local storage...? save game state as json?

- lerp item movement - still fucky




- game slow after running level chooser. need to refresh to fix...?


- jump max height only when button held
- jump height depends on velX
- pause at apex of jump



- make view padding dynamic:
    1P: tight when still, zoom out when moving. Make zoom a function of speed
    MP: tight when close, zoom out when further apart



- particles (flames) need blank canvas so bg doesn't influence color


- logging & error trapping: window.on_error()


- better scenery rendering :
    - clipping seems to be an issue with rocks (msedge & safari)
    - make sure rock details don't overlap
    - (optional) outlines


- hitboxes and collision is still fucky!!!


- fix item renderer

- outline all the things!!!


- environment shit: bugs, birds, leaves, flowers, wisps

- ropes/vines

- things in extreme FG

- grass & environment animations - gentle sway and react to player enturbulation






- curve and hump geometry support


- quad tree????!?!??!?!?!?!!??!??


- jump window before/after touch ground - need to fix this

- tile variances (darker and lighter)


- Ellipse and set line dash not supported by everybody


- hash nav not working in MS browsers




- fire particles need to respect physics better...





- reduce obj creation









- (full) controller support

- make sure spawn is safe



- see if water can invert to make more classic looking waves with peaks




- grass should always render in front of player
** Nope : Player remains behind colliders _unless_ player is jumping!!!1
- control player z-index somehow




- wave (actually, all) physics should be loaded from level instead of theme (or hard coded...i'm looking at YOU stage.js)




- add shadow to bg - store bg id & poly memory, clip and draw shadow later...can use this for trees tooo 



- draw attention to player damage and respawn!!






- tiles

- torches

- quicksand (and in general)


- particles



- water/lava/sand/goo fall

- death & respawn


- more advanced movers (path, rotate)
  
 




- grass / trees / flowers



 
 



- ramps need to slide

    













- see if there is a way to slow game speed w/o delta stepper
- unify game timestamps (animation, player, debug) to all use loop timer for now() - need solution to last(), likely a function...





- center player better when not on lowest ground layer...need to hamdle ground not being bottom of level!!!!! 











- sync dev ui when loading - save settings would be nice









- smoother scrolling on level chooser: maybe 1 double-sized canvas panel?


- more than 1 visible canvas: 1 for each cached layer. draw once and move relative to fg canvas


- need list of item properties : draw, collide, collide-top, canjump, collide-damage, collide-kill, collide-bounce...

- add optional theme physics modifiers (jungle, lava, ice, space, ...)

- implement "real" WebRTC phone controller





- weapons & death

- hotkeys

- pause game (grey screen)

- toggle sound icon & sound in general

- settings


- fix all animations

- add random blink, look around state
- need multiple "idle" animations (choose randomly but wisely!)

- custom name, color, stats

- draw pixel grid if debug mode

- quads for render and collide: load static level items in areaQuad, actors in pointQuad
  https://github.com/mikechambers/ExamplesByMesh/tree/master/JavaScript/QuadTree

- find out why player4 is "stronger" than other players - something to do with update order...? (he gets processed last so always wins)

- level editor

- player editor






























- player stats:     health =/= strength =/= speed
                    fast and weak vs. strong and slow - choose wisely!
                    
                    i.e. you get 20 points to spend...
                    
                    health:   XXXXXXXX--
                    strength: XXXXX-----
                    speed:    XXXXXXX---
                    
                    - size of character is based on strength - weak characters are small, strong characters are big?
                    - * need a way to immediately represent how healthy a player is (including what percent is left?)
                    - strength: weight in collisions, power when pushing, movement speed when lifting




- Use 'Bounty Hunters' as a story framework? Detective agency? Pizza delivery?



- "The Boondoggle" -> Map name?


- Rock Paper Scissors with player classes?  -> Bruiser -> Hero -> Pinto ->
